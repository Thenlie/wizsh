A simple shell written in C. This shell was created as a final project for the Harvard CS50 course. As my first real dive into independent C programming, it was an amazing tool to learn the ins and outs of C, git and how shells function on a lower level. Bash and zsh were the main inspirations for the shell, the latter inspiring the name as well. 

The initial goal was to create a simple command line interface that accepted specific commands and responded to them. As I progressed, I eventually wanted this to become a fully featured shell with git integration, directory navigation and more!
